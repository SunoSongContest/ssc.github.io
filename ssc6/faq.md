# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

## Submissions:

Q: Can I submit a song I've already published elsewhere?

A: Yes, as long as it hasn't been used in any previous SSC season (including challenges) and isn't part of another creator challenge (e.g. Timbaland Remix, Halloween challenge).


Q: I missed the initial submission window. Can I still enter SSC6?

A: Maybe. If there are open spots after the initial window, the committee may open a second submission period. Check the Discord channels for announcements.


Q: How are songs assigned to the weekly playlists?

A: Randomly, after the submission window closes.


Q: Can I edit my song during the contest?

A: Only to make corrections requested by the committee, within 24 hours of notification. No changes are allowed once your song is accepted.


Q: My song is slightly longer than 5 minutes, but it ends with silence. Does this qualify?

A: Yes, as long as the music itself ends by the 5-minute mark. Trailing silence is not counted towards the duration.


Q: Can I use AI-generated lyrics for my song?

A: Yes, as long as they comply with Suno's Terms of Service and the SSC6 content guidelines (PG-13, no problematic content, even if AI-hallucinated). But we highly value original, human-written lyrics!


Q: I used an abbreviation for my country in the SSC6 tag. Is that okay?

A: Yes, common acronyms (like USA, UK) are acceptable. For less common abbreviations, use the full English country name to avoid confusion.


Q: How important is the 55-character title limit?

A: It's a recommendation. Longer titles might be shortened in the voting polls, so keeping it concise helps ensure your full title is displayed.


## Voting:

Q: I'm a Suno user but not participating in SSC6. Can I still vote?

A: No, only participants with accepted songs can vote. Join the chat and the live streams, and join us to submit a song and vote in SSC7!


Q: I lost my voting password. What do I do?

A: DM a committee member for assistance.


Q: How does the Eurovision-style voting work?

A: You'll assign points to your favorite songs: 12 points to your top pick, 10 to your second favorite, and 1-8 points to eight other songs. Zero points to all the rest. More details will be provided with the voting form.


Q: What constitutes "campaigning" for votes, and what are the penalties?

A: Asking for votes directly or indirectly, exchanging votes, or any other attempt to unfairly influence voting is considered campaigning. Penalties, including disqualification, are at the committee's discretion.


## Best Brand New:

Q: If I make a new song and submit it, is that enough to qualify for "Best Brand New?"

A: No, you must include “SSC6-7369” as the first style tag in your prompt before initial generation. Just adding it to the song details later won't count.


Q: Can I submit a "Brand New" song and another song to the contest?

A: No, only one song submission per participant is allowed. The Brand New song competes in both the main contest and the Brand New category.


## General:

Q: I have a question not covered in this FAQ. Who should I contact?

A: Reach out to @JoshuaSodil, @Teemuth, or @JonathanKennedy via DM on Discord.


Q: How can I stay updated on SSC6 announcements and events?

A: Join the SSC Discord server for reminders and important information. Follow @sunosongcontest on social media and use the #SSC6 hashtag.
