# üì• How to vote

Fill in the form, use your voting password, Eurovision-style voting!
___

New in SSC6, we will use *Forms* to cast your votes each week! 
Every week, we will share a voting form where all SSC6 participants can cast their votes for the songs from that week.
 
The voting period will open every Friday around 12 p.m. UTC and will end every Sunday around 12 p.m. UTC.

**Important:** Only SSC6 participants can vote. Each participant with an accepted song will receive a <ins>voting password</ins> that you will need to submit in the form in order to vote. Please keep your voting password secret and safe - and if you forget it, reach out to one of the committee members.

## Points-based voting
If you‚Äôre familiar with Eurovision, this will be very familiar - ‚ÄúDouze Points!!‚Äù

For SSC6, we will use a points-based voting system. You will be able to choose which songs receive 12 points, 10 points, and one song each for 1-8 points. 

Voting results will be checked and revealed every Sunday. Each week, the top 5 songs will progress to the finals. If any songs tie, they‚Äôll all advance to the finals together.

## Second Chance Voting
Each week, the next 5 highest-ranking songs (including ties) that didn‚Äôt reach the finals will join the Second Chance candidate list. After week 5, we‚Äôll hold a Second Chance vote across all Second Chance candidates to choose the top songs from this group.

In this vote, we‚Äôll select as many songs as needed to bring the finals lineup to 30 songs. If the finals already have 30 songs due to ties, we‚Äôll still add at least one more song from Second Chance voting. We'll use a tiebreaker in the rare case of a tie here.


## ‚ÄúNo campaigning‚Äù rule
Suno Song Contest is about sharing your creativity and connecting with others over incredible music! 

It is not about ‚Äòlikes‚Äô or ‚Äòtrending‚Äô. While we know many of us have friends in the community, please vote for the songs you like based on the music, and don‚Äôt ask your friends for votes. 

If you see someone asking for votes or doing something you‚Äôre not comfortable with, please bring it to our attention. 

We reserve the right to disqualify or penalize anyone if there is evidence they are attempting to manipulate the system or influence voting. Any action taken will be at the committee‚Äôs discretion to ensure the integrity and spirit of SSC.
