# 📩 How to submit songs

Fill in the form. We will contact you for corrections and/or when your song is accepted. Then wait for the weekly reveals to learn when your song is playing!
___

New in SSC6, we will be using Google Forms to submit information about your songs and to vote!

**Important:** <ins>Only songs submitted through the official form will be accepted.</ins> We encourage you to share your SSC6 song in the Discord chat so others can listen, but you must submit a form as well.

We will ask you for:
* Your Discord account so we know how to find you and communicate with you

* Your Suno user name and Song - so we know what song you are submitting

* Background information about your song so we can help promote it and celebrate your success when you reach the finals!

After you submit your form, we will check the songs to ensure they follow the guidelines. 

If we need you to update any details in your song—like correcting the song title or duration—we will contact you, and you will have 24 hours to make any adjustments or resubmit another song.


After your song has been approved, you will receive a message from one of us to let you know you’ve made it into SSC6! 

**Important:**
* When you have submitted the form, please also send a direct message to one of @JoshuaSodil, @teemuth, or @jonathankennedy so we can contact you back for any corrections or acceptance.
* When your song has been approved, your acceptance message will also include your <ins>voting password</ins>, which you will need when voting each week. Keep it secret, keep it safe!

We will keep it a surprise which songs will participate in each week… so stay tuned for the weekly playlist reveals every Monday!
