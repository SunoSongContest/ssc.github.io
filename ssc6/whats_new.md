# 6️⃣ What's new?

SSC6 will be similar to previous seasons in that it is all about appreciating each others’ music and creativity!

If you were here for previous seasons of SSC, here’s what’s different or new about SSC6:

* **200 songs**: 200 songs overall, split into 5 weekly rounds of 40 songs, with a finals week. Each week, 5 songs will progress to the finals.

* **Single submission window**: We will have one long submission period for all 200 songs, and will then assign songs to weeks randomly. Check out the timeline for all the details

* **No resubmissions**: Each participant can only submit one song for SSC6.

* **Forms**: Submitting songs and voting will happen using Google forms - to help us automate some of the work!

* **Live streams**: The streams are here to stay! Join us live to watch everyone’s songs and dance in chat!

* **Sunovision voting**: We are introducing a new voting system where you will assign points to your favorite songs, similar to Eurovision voting, for a more consistent and fair vote overall.

* **2nd-chance voting is back:** The top songs from each week that didn’t make it to the finals will have another chance to make it through a 2nd-chance voting round after week 5.

* **“No campaigning” rule**: SSC is all about appreciating everybody’s music, not about ‘like me’ tactics. If we find people trying to game the system or influence votes, we may penalize them at the committee’s discretion.

* **Wildcard prize for new songs**: We like to encourage new songs created for SSC6! The creator of the highest-ranking new song (except for SSC6 winner) will be able to submit a song directly to the finals of next season - SSC7!

* **Event reminders**: Join our SSC discord server to get reminders for events, voting periods, and other announcements!

* **Some surprises along the way**: Well, that’s a surprise, no?
