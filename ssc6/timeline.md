## Submissions period

Submissions for SSC6 will start on Wednesday, October 30, around 12 p.m. UTC, and the window will close when we reach 200 songs or on Sunday, November 3, whichever happens sooner.

*If* we have extra spaces remaining after the submission period, we may open up another submission period at the committeeâ€™s discretion. But if you want to guarantee that your song will be in SSC6 - submit as soon as possible!

We want to encourage submissions from all around the world - the committee may decide to limit to no more than 80 songs from any single continent - and they will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis.


## SSC6 preliminaries

We will have 5 weeks starting Nov 4 to listen to all songs. Each week we will listen to and vote on 40 songs, which will be randomly assigned from all accepted songs.

### Preliminaries Weekly Schedule: Starting Nov 4 - Dec 8

* **Playlist announced**: We will announce the songs of the week in a playlist released around 12 p.m. UTC every Monday.

* **Promotion periods**: Starting Monday, participants will be allowed to present and promote their songs twice during the week! Tell everyone how you wrote it, why it matters to you - and tell others what you appreciated about their songs!

* **Live streams**: Every week, join us live for two live-streaming sessions where we will listen to songs, comment on them, and appreciate all the creativity with guests, dancing emojis, and more!

* **Voting**: We will open the voting period for songs every week between Friday at 12 p.m. UTC and Sunday at 12 p.m. UTC.


### Community & Challenge week: Dec 9 - Dec 15

After week 5 is over, we will take a one-week break to celebrate all the participants and prepare for **finals week!** We will have some fun challenges during this week with a few more surprises, so stay tuned!


### Finals week: Dec 16 - Dec 21

We will listen to all finalists in the live streams, and will open the voting period between Monday at 12 p.m. UTC and Friday at 12 p.m. UTC.
