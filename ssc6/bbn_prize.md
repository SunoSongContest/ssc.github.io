# 🎉 Best brand new and wildcard prize

Add tag `SSC6-736945` to the style tag and you may win the title of ‘best brand new’ and a wildcard ticket to SSC7 finals!

___

We like encouraging participants to create brand-new songs! So we have something very special for brand new songs this time…

To participate in the “brand new song” category, your song must include the word `SSC6-736945` in your style tag.

The creator of the highest-ranking brand-new song will receive:

* A **wildcard ticket** to submit a song directly to the finals of SSC7!

* The right to add `[SSC6 Best Brand New]` in the title of their song

**Note**: If the overall winner of SSC6 is a brand new song, the “best brand new” wildcard ticket and title will be bestowed on the next highest-ranking brand new song, to share the love!
