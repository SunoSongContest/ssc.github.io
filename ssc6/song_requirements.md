# 🎶 Song requirements

Follow these rules so we can all enjoy the music. Songs or participants that violate the rules may disqualified at the committee’s discretion.
___

* **One song per person:** Each participant can submit only one single song for SSC6

* **No changes:** Do not alter anything about your song—lyrics, title, image—or anything else during the contest, unless required by the staff.

* **Language:** The song must be either instrumental or in a language recognized by Google Translate. Mixed languages are allowed. 

* **Lyrics:** 

   * The full lyrics of your song must be visible throughout the entire contest. 
   
   * Lyrics must follow Suno’s Terms of Service - meaning they must be original or be in the public domain (e.g. a poem whose author has been dead for at least 70 years).

* **Duration:** The song must be between 2:00 minutes and 5:00 minutes long. Silence at the end of the track will not count towards this duration as long as the music ends completely by 5:00 minutes.

* **Title and SSC6 tag:**
   * The title of the song must not include emojis, fantasy fonts, and/or decorations.
   
   * Each title must end with SSC6 and country ID in the format:  Song Name [SSC6, Country].

   * Please use the English name of the country; common acronyms (USA, UK, UAE) are accepted.

   * We recommend keeping the song title within 55 characters. Longer titles may be truncated in voting polls


* **PG-13 content rating, and avoid copyright/trademarks:**

* By "content" we mean anything that is visible either in the song's page on Suno, or in the embed on Discord. This includes lyrics, style prompt, title, image, author's name.

* We will check the content to ensure it is either G-rated or PG-13-rated, as defined by the Motion Picture Association film rating system, plus some additional requirements for legal safety.

* **In short:** no expletives* or foul language; no descriptions of, or calls to, drug use; no racism or discrimination of any kind; no politics; no direct references to copyrighted works or trademarks.

* * This includes any AI hallucinations that may be present in your music


* **Compliance:**

   * We will check all songs for these requirements. 
   
   * If your song does not follow the requirements, we will ask you to correct it before accepting it - and you will have a limited amount of time to submit the corrections. 
   
   * We reserve the right to disqualify songs during the contest if we find new information that they do not follow the requirements. 

   * Any participant who violates the song requirements intentionally (e.g., hiding lyrics, using egregious foul language) may be further barred from future seasons.

* **Song ending:** Songs must have a proper ending. They must not terminate abruptly, e.g. in the middle of a note.

* **No previous SSC songs:** You can submit any song including previously published songs, as long as they have not participated in any previous SSC season - including challenge songs. 

* **No other creator challenges:** To avoid interfering with Suno’s official challenges, we will not accept songs intended for any other Suno challenges, such as the Timbaland Remix Challenge, or any Halloween-related songs.
